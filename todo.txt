future development

- improve documentation
  - clean up, remove unnecessary examples
  - example for one-time task with state
  - migration guide for updating to newer versions (new column)

- optimize scheduler to look an interval forward in time, and trigger next cycle earlier if there are an immediate execution
  - keep a list if executions due between now and next interval

- automatic tests for oracle and mysql using docker containers? (how easy is that?)

- customizable table-name

- profile for varying target db (hsql/postgresql) for tests

- only update heartbeats if execution older than one heartbeat interval/cycles


far future
- support transactional taskRepositories
   - so far, jdbctaskrepository requires TransactionAwareDataSource for reliable scheduling of new tasks in transaction
- cron schedule? (separate artifact if dependencies)
