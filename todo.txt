future development

- move getFailingExecutions(Duration failingAtLeastFor) into client

- optimize scheduler to look an interval forward in time, and trigger next cycle earlier if there are an immediate execution
  - keep a list if executions due between now and next interval

- redesign api so that an ad-hoc task can be scheduled without having a reference to the Task-object

- automatic tests for oracle and mysql using docker containers

- profile for varying target db (hsql/postgresql) for tests

- only update heartbeats if execution older than one heartbeat interval/cycles

- cron schedule? (separate artifact if dependencies)
